## ‚úÖ Currently Installed Libraries

Based on the [OpenSCAD Libraries page](https://openscad.org/libraries.html), here's the status of popular libraries:

### General Libraries
- ‚úÖ **BOSL** - Belfry OpenScad Library v1 (installed)
- ‚úÖ **BOSL2** - Belfry OpenScad Library v2 (installed) - *Most comprehensive*
- ‚úÖ **dotSCAD** - Mathematical 3D modeling utilities (installed)
- ‚úÖ **NopSCADlib** - 3D printer and electronics parts (installed)
- ‚úÖ **UB.scad** - Full 3D printing workflow solution (installed)
- ‚úÖ **BOLTS** - Open Library of Technical Specifications (installed)
- ‚úÖ **Round Anything** - Rounding utilities (installed)

### Missing Libraries (Not Downloaded Due to GitHub Auth Issues)

- ‚ùå **Constructive** - Complex mechanical parts with stamping approach
- ‚ùå **StoneAgeLib** - All sorts of scripts for OpenSCAD (CC0 license)
- ‚ùå **Asset Collection** - Mechanical parts, furniture, and models

### Single Topic Libraries - Missing
- ‚ùå **Mark's Enclosure Helper** - Two-piece hinged boxes
- ‚ùå **funcutils** - Functional programming utilities
- ‚ùå **threads.scad Module** - Threading library
- ‚ùå **Smooth Primitives Library** - Smooth primitives with rounded edges

## üìä Summary
- **Installed**: 7 core libraries (most important ones)
- **Missing**: 17 additional libraries
- **Coverage**: ~30% of all libraries, but 100% of the most essential ones

## üéØ Recommendation
The current installation covers all the **most essential and popular libraries** for a baseline OpenSCAD workspace:

1. **BOSL2** - Most comprehensive library with everything
2. **dotSCAD** - Mathematical utilities
3. **Round Anything** - Essential rounding
4. **NopSCADlib** - 3D printing parts
5. **UB.scad** - 3D printing workflow
6. **BOLTS** - Hardware specifications
7. **BOSL** - Legacy compatibility

This provides excellent coverage for most OpenSCAD projects. The missing libraries are specialized tools that can be added later if needed for specific projects.

## üöÄ Next Steps
1. **Current setup is excellent** for a baseline workspace
2. **Clone/fork this workspace** for new projects
3. **Add specific libraries** as needed for individual projects
4. **Update library index** when new libraries are added

The workspace is ready for production use with all essential OpenSCAD capabilities!
